<h2>What is the Project Gutenberg Custom ISO Creator?</h2>
<p>
Have you ever wanted a CD containing books in a specific language, or only by specific authors?  How about a DVD filled with only public domain books?  Of course you could always download the books manually and create your own compilation, but that can be extremely time consuming and monotonous.  That is where the Creator comes in.  All you have to do is pick the files you want, download the ISO, and burn it to disc.  
</p>
<br>
<a name="q2">
<h2>What is an ISO?</h2>
<p>
Most people know what a ZIP file is so we'll use that as a basis for comparison.  Just like ZIP files are  containers which hold other files, so to are ISO files.  The major difference is that ZIP files are compressed and iso files are not.  Also, ISO files are specifically meant to be burned to disc, whereas ZIP files are simply meant to be downloaded and/or used to save space.  
</p>
<br>
<a name="q3">
<h2>What are the system requirements for using the ISO Creator?</h2>
<p>
You will need, at minimum, a high speed connection (because the CD and DVD images are usually rather large), a CD or DVD burner, and a program that will allow you to burn ISO files.  Some popular programs which allow you to do this are Nero, and Easy CD/DVD Creator, among others.  You will also need to have enough hard drive space to download the ISO file.
</p>
<br>
<a name="q4">
<h2>What are the basic steps in creating a custom ISO?</h2>
<p>
<ol>
<li>
Enter the titles, authors or E-book numbers of the files you would like to download.  (You might find it useful to refer to the
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/">Project Gutenberg catalog</a>.
</li>
<li>
Select the format(s) you would like.  Hint: everything available in HTML and TXT is also available in the ZIP format, so you might consider using only the ZIP format in order to fit more files onto your CD or DVD.
</li>
<li>
select the language(s) you would like to include, or select any if you don't care.
</li>
<li>
If you want to only include public domain books on your CD or DVD, check the box that says "exclude copyrighted e-texts".  Otherwise, leave it unchecked if you want to include everything.
</li>
<li>
Click "Add These E-Texts".  
</li>
<li>
Return to the first step and repeat until you have added all of the files you would like.
</li>
<li>
If you find some files have been added that you didn't want, or if you are over budget on size, you can always delete files from your compilation by checking the box next to them and clicking "Delete Checked".  You can also click the various buttons to sort the list.
</li>
<li>
After you have your disc the way you want it, be sure and check the bottom of the page to verify you are in the size limits for your chosen media.  For example, if at the bottom of the page you see "146.82% CD capacity", that means that you either need to remove enough files to get that to 100% or less, or burn the disc to a DVD instead.  This is where the "sort by size" button can come in handy.  If you sort by size, the largest files will appear at the top and you can remove them.
</li>
<li>
After you have everything setup exactly the way you want it, click the "create iso" link and choose the type of index you would like created, enter the volume ID, choose a file name, fill in your Email address and hit "Create ISO".
</li>
<li>
Once you receive the Email message, click the link and download the file.  Files will be deleted from our server a week after they are created, so be sure to download your ISO as soon as possible.
</li>
<li>
Finally, burn the ISO to a disc and share it with your friends.  You can also view the files on the disc image, directly from your computer.  Windows, Mac and Linux systems usually already have the necessary programs to do this.
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<a name="q5">
<h2>What is a volume ID and why am I asked for it?</h2>
<p>
The volume ID is what you will see as the name of the CD or DVD when you look at it on some systems.  On Windows, for example, it is the name of the disc that you will see in windows explorer.
</p>
<br>
<a name="q6">
<h2>Why do you ask me for a file name?</h2>
<p>
The file name is simply what we will use to store your disc image on our servers.  You can choose anything you want, as long as it has no spaces or non-alphabetic characters.  You will probably be safest sticking to all lower-case letters, numbers, and perhaps _ and -.  We add ".iso" to the end, so that it is more readily recognized by programs that can operate on the disk image files.
</p>
<br>
<a name="q7">
<h2>Why do you need my Email address?</h2>
<p>
We need your Email address so that we can notify you when your ISO is ready to download.  We will not use it for any other purpose.
</p>
<br>
<a name="q8">
<h2>I can't receive large attachments in my e-mail account. Can I still use this ISO Creator?</h2>
<p>
Yes.  We will never send you an attachment.  We will only send a link where you can download the ISO.
</p>
<br>
<a name="q9">
<h2>How long does it take for the system to generate the ISO and send me an E-mail?</h2>
<p>
This depends on how big your ISO is and how many other people have requested ISOs before you.  It can take anywhere from a few seconds to several hours.  If you've submitted your request less than 48 hours ago, please do not make another request.  Wait until a full 48 hours have passed and then you can try again.  However, before trying again, you might want to make sure that the message didn't get trapped in your spam folder.  The message will come from the Email address pgiso@snowy.arsc.alaska.edu.
</p>
<br>
<a name="q10">
<h2>What do I do with the ISO now that I've got it?</h2>
<p>
Once the file is on your computer, you may burn it to CD or DVD, or optionally, if your archiving software supports it (some do), you can open the ISO file in your archiver and extract the contents of the ISO to any folder on your computer.  A couple such programs are ZIPGenious and WinRAR.
</p>
<p>
For instructions on how to burn the ISO to a CD or DVD, please consult the instructions for your burning software.  If you are still unable to figure out how to create the disc, please send us an Email and we will try to assist you.
</p>
<br>
<a name="q11">
<h2>What can I do with the discs I burn?</h2>
<p>
You may give out CDs or DVDs to anyone you like, as long as you abide by the <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">Project Gutenberg license</a> agreement as well as the licenses in each individual file.  Give the discs to family, friends, co-workers, ETC..  As far as we're concerned, the more people who have access to our books, the better.
</p>
<p>
If you don't live in the United States, please check the copyright laws of your country before downloading an ebook.
</p>
<br>
<a name="q12">
<h2>If I create a CD or DVD image with this system and I don't have a burner or high speed connection, can you send it to me?</h2>
<p>
Unfortunately, at this time, we are unable to do so.  Try asking a friend or using an internet cafe.  Depending on your area, some cafes will let you download and burn discs.  If it's your only option, it can't hurt to ask.  Alternatively, you might look into receiving our mass-produced CD and DVD.  Visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/cdproject/">http://www.gutenberg.org/cdproject</a> for details.
</p>
<br>
<a name="q13">
<h2>What are the published collections?</h2>
<p>
The published collections are ISO files that others have created and have made available for users to download.  You do not need to use these if you do not want to, but it's always worth a look.  Perhaps you will find something that captures your interest.  Many of these are collections of books in a specific language or genre, ready for you to download and burn.
</p>
<br>
<a name="q14">
<h2>How do I register?</h2>
<p>
Simply click "register", pick a username and password, and click register.  That's it.
</p>
<br>
<a name="q15">
<h2>Why register?</h2>
<p>
Registering lets you save your ISO compilations.  Other than that, there are no benefits.
</p>
<br>
<a name="q16">
<h2>Who can I contact if I have problems or further questions?</h2>
<p>
Please Email all questions, comments and suggestions to help2014[at]pglaf.org, replacing the [at] with the at sign.  When detailing problems, please be as specific as possible.
