make_iso.pl seems to have problems.

No files being put in the directory /data1/pgiso_temp

Empty index (no files) if it is plain text, or HTML.
Logged out, or not.
Single/multi/alpha-page index file.
From an existing published collection: same problem

Test:
 - a new session?
 - updated rdf info

*** Seems that the -c is a difference.  If it is saved
as a collection, works ok.  No collection, and it doesn't.

There is also a difference with session names v. login
names, but I'm not sure that matters (earlier experimentation
didn't show a difference).
