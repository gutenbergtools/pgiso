The ISO creation process has completed.  Your ISO file is ready to download...

The file is available at the following address:
  _FTP_URL_
  MD5 Checksum: _MD5_CHECKSUM_
  File size: _SIZEOUTPUT_

  ** But wait!	If you saw "File size: 376832", chances are your ISO
     is not populated.	This is most likely because you did not
     actually select any eBooks for your image.	 If you didn't get a
     listing of book titles, formats, and sizes - along with a line at
     the bottom of the "Add files" telling you how many ETexts Total
     you have, then you did not add any to the collection.

     In that case, please go back and make a new collection, by adding
     files and formats.	 Then, you can try again to make an ISO.
     You'll get a new email like this, with a new link.

Once you have a successful ISO, you have up to two weeks to download
this file before it is deleted.
